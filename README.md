# MineSweeper

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular grid containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. Players reveal the contents of each square on the grid, which can either be empty, contain a number indicating the adjacent mines, or be a mine itself. Utilizing logic and deduction, players strategically mark squares they suspect contain mines, aiming to clear the entire grid without triggering any explosions. I have somehow been able to code a clone of this game using Java. This project spaned over 1 month, with 50+ hours being worked on it (mostly debugging ðŸ˜­). Update log below.
